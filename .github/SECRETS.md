# GitHub Actions secrets for Driver-Mobile-App

Every workflow in `.github/workflows/` needs these secrets set in
**Repo Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Repository secrets**.

Nothing here is optional — a missing secret fails the run at the step that reads it.

## Shorebird (1)

| Secret | Where to get it |
| --- | --- |
| `SHOREBIRD_TOKEN` | Shorebird Console → Account → API Keys → Create key. Paste the token as-is. |

Verify: run the `Shorebird Smoke Test` workflow first. It only checks auth.

## Android signing (7)

| Secret | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | `base64 -i upload-keystore.jks \| pbcopy` on macOS. Paste the string. |
| `ANDROID_STORE_PASSWORD` | The keystore's storePassword. |
| `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` | The key's password (often the same as storePassword). |
| `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` | The alias inside the keystore, e.g. `upload`. |
| `MAPS_API_KEY` | Google Maps API key from Google Cloud Console. |
| `MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Mapbox public access token (`pk.` prefix) from account.mapbox.com. Used at runtime by the app. Driver only. |
| `MAPBOX_DOWNLOADS_TOKEN` | Mapbox secret download token (`sk.` prefix) from account.mapbox.com. Used by Gradle to download the Mapbox SDK during build. Without it Android build fails with 401 Unauthorized. Driver only. |

## iOS signing (3)

| Secret | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `IOS_CERTIFICATE_BASE64` | Distribution certificate exported from Keychain as `.p12`, then `base64 -i cert.p12 \| pbcopy`. |
| `IOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | Password you set when exporting the .p12. |
| `IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64` | The `.mobileprovision` for the prod bundle ID, `base64 -i profile.mobileprovision \| pbcopy`. |

## Google Play (1)

Used by the "Upload to Google Play" step in `shorebird_release_android.yaml`.

Generate a service account:
1. Play Console → Setup → API access → Choose or create a Google Cloud project
2. Create service account (in Google Cloud IAM) → grant role **Service Account User**
3. Back in Play Console → API access → Grant access to that service account → give it "Release manager" (or "Release apps to testing tracks only" for stricter scope)
4. In Google Cloud IAM → click the service account → Keys → Add key → JSON. A `.json` file downloads.

You can reuse the SAME service account across User-Mobile-App and Driver-Mobile-App — just grant it access to both Play apps in the Play Console.

**First-ever upload to a Play app must be done by hand.** Google refuses API uploads until the app exists in Play Console with at least one build. After that, this workflow works.

| Secret | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | Full contents of the downloaded `.json` file (paste as-is, including braces). Same value as User-Mobile-App if you reuse the service account. |

## App Store Connect API (3)

Used by the "Upload to App Store Connect" step in `shorebird_release_ios.yaml`.

Generate the key in **App Store Connect → Users and Access → Integrations → App Store Connect API**.
Role must be **App Manager** or higher. The `.p8` file can only be downloaded once — save it.

You can reuse the SAME ASC key across both User-Mobile-App and Driver-Mobile-App repos — one key covers every app in the team.

| Secret | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `ASC_ISSUER_ID` | Shown at the top of the Keys tab. Same value as User-Mobile-App. |
| `ASC_KEY_ID` | Shown on the key row. Same value as User-Mobile-App if you reuse the key. |
| `ASC_KEY_P8` | Full contents of the `.p8` file, including the BEGIN/END PRIVATE KEY lines. |

## Total: 15 secrets

Run the smoke test workflow first, then a `staging` Android release (cheapest full test),
then a `staging` iOS release (proves signing + ASC upload work), then `production` / `prod`.
